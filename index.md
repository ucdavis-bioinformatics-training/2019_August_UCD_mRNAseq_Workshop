* Bioinformatics related questions, include but not limited to bioinformatic methods questions, software use, data questions.
  * bioinformatics.core@ucdavis.edu
* Computing Issues, include but not limited to user account questions, equipment failure/malfunction, software install, software failures (not related to use)
  * helpdesk@genomecenter.ucdavis.edu

## Workshop Goals

* End to End understanding of RNAseq differential
  * Discussions/lectures
  * Technologies
  * Experimental design
  * Cost estimation
  * Workflow
  * mRNA gene expression analysis
* To work through a complete experiment, starting from raw data to completion, including making a few figures.
* Goal is 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on

## Internet

You will need to access the UCD wireless via your laptop to participate in the hands-on exercises. Please review https://itcatalog.ucdavis.edu/service/ucd-guest-wireless for access instructions.

Many academic (and some non-academic) institutions are part of Eduroam. (See "List of Institutions" under
"Members" at https://www.eduroam.us/ to find out if your institution is a member.) Please make sure you
can log into Eduroam with your device at your home institution, which will make things easier once you come to UCD.

If your institution is not a member of Eduroam, you can still access the open wireless through "ucd-guest".
