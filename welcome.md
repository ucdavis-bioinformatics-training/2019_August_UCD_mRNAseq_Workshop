  * mRNA gene expression analysis
* To work through a complete experiment, starting from raw data to completion, including making a few figures.
* Goal is 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on

## Internet

You will need to access the UCD wireless via your laptop to participate in the hands-on exercises.

### Eduroam

Many academic institutions are part of Eduroam. (See "List of Institutions" under
"Members" at https://www.eduroam.us/ to find out if your institution is a member.) Please make sure you
can log into Eduroam with your device at your home institution, which will make things easier once you come to UCD.

### UCD Guest wireless
